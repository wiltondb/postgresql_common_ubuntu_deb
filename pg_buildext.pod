pg_buildext - Build and install a PostgreSQL extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_buildext> I<action> I<target> I<opts>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pg_buildext> is a script that will build a PostgreSQL extension in a C<VPATH>
way. It supports the B<configure>, B<build>, B<install>, and B<clean> actions,
and will choose to build for the intersection of versions known in
C<debian/pgversions> (versions supported by the package) and in
C</usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions> (versions supported in this
release).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<action>

One of B<configure>, B<build>, B<install>, or B<clean>.

=item B<target>

The target directory where to build the sources, it will get created for you
if it does not exist. If the B<target> contains a C<%v> sign, it will get
replaced by the specific version of PostgreSQL being built against.
(Usually C<build-%v>.)

=item B<opts>

C<%v> signs in B<opts> will get replaced as in B<target>.

=over 4

=item B<configure>

Options to pass to the I<configure> script. (Most PostgreSQL extensions do not
have a configure script.)

=item B<build>

Custom C<CFLAGS> options to use for the build.

=item B<install>

Package name to install for. Make will be called with DESTDIR="$(CURDIR)/debian/I<package>".

=item B<clean>

B<clean> does not take extra options.

=head1 SUPPORTED VERSIONS

B<pg_buildext> reads C<debian/pgversions> to decide which PostgreSQL to build
modules/extensions for. This file contains one PostgreSQL version number per
line, in the following formats:

=over 4

=item B<all>

Support all versions. This is recommended unless there are known incompatibilities.

=item I<X.Y>

Support this version.

=item I<X.Y>B<+>

Support this and all greater versions.

=item B<#>I<...>

Comment.

=back

For a version to be used, it must also be listed in the output of
C</usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions>. See this file for how to
configure the list of supported versions on your system.

=head1 USAGE

As B<pg_buildext> invokes B<make> for the B<build>, B<install>, and B<clean>
actions, invocations from C<debian/rules> (which is a makefile) should be prefixed
with B<+> so the sub-makes can talk with the make jobserver.

=head1 EXAMPLE

  build-stamp:
	  +pg_buildext configure $(CURDIR) build-%v "--libdir=/usr/lib/postgresql/%v/lib --datadir=/usr/share/postgresql-%v-plsh"
	  +pg_buildext build $(CURDIR) build-%v

  install: build
	  +pg_buildext install $(CURDIR) build-%v postgresql-%v-plsh

  clean:
	  +pg_buildext clean $(CURDIR) build-%v
