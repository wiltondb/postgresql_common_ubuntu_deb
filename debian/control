 PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
 system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
 to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:
 ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,
 triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion
 concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
 programming languages are available as well.

Description: manager for multiple PostgreSQL client versions
 postgresql-client-common provides a structure under which multiple
 versions of PostgreSQL client programs may be installed at the same
 time. It provides a wrapper which selects the right version for the
 particular cluster you want to access (with a command line option, an
 environment variable, /etc/postgresql-commmon/user_clusters, or
 ~/.postgresqlrc).
