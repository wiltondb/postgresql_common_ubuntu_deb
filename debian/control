Description: manager for PostgreSQL database clusters
 postgresql-common provides a structure under which multiple versions of
 PostgreSQL may be installed and/or multiple clusters maintained at one
 time.
 .
 If you have openssl installed, this package will automatically create a (self
 signed) SSL certificate so that SSL works out of the box.
 .
 PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
 system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
 to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:
 ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,
 triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion
 concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
 programming languages are available as well.
