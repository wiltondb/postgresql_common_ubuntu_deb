Type: error
_Description: Obsolete major version ${old}
 The PostgreSQL version ${old} is obsolete, but the server
 or client packages are still installed. Please install the latest packages
 (postgresql-${latest} and postgresql-client-${latest}) and upgrade the
 existing ${oldversion} clusters with pg_upgradecluster (see manpage).
 .
 Please be aware that the installation of postgresql-${latest} will
 automatically create a default cluster ${latest}/main. If you want to upgrade
 the ${old}/main cluster, you need to remove the already existing ${latest}
 cluster (pg_dropcluster --stop ${latest} main, see manpage for
 details).
 .
 The old server and client packages are no longer supported. After the
 existing clusters are upgraded, the postgresql-${old} and
 postgresql-client-${old} packages should be removed.
 .
 Please see /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz for details.

_Description: Enable SSL by default in new PostgreSQL clusters?
 PostgreSQL supports SSL-encrypted connections. This is usually a good thing.
 However, if the database is solely accessed using TCP connections on
 localhost, SSL can be turned off without introducing security issues.
 .
 UNIX domain socket connections (called "local" in pg_hba.conf) are not
 affected by this setting. This setting concerns new PostgreSQL clusters
 created during package install, or by using the pg_createcluster command. It
 does not reconfigure existing clusters.
 .
 If unsure, enable SSL.

Template: postgresql-common/catversion-bump
Type: note
_Description: PostgreSQL ${version} catalog version changed
 The PostgreSQL cluster ${version} ${cluster} was created using catalog
 version ${db_catversion}, but the currently being installed package
 postgresql-${version} is using catalog version ${new_catversion}. You will not
 be able to use this cluster until it was upgraded to the new catalog version.
 .
 The necessary subset of binaries from the old version was saved in
 ${vartmpdir}. To upgrade the cluster, execute these commands:
 .
   pg_renamecluster ${version} ${cluster} ${cluster}.old
   pg_upgradecluster ${version} ${cluster}.old --rename ${cluster} \
     -m upgrade --old-bindir=${vartmpdir}/bin
   pg_dropcluster ${version} ${cluster}.old
   rm -rf ${vartmpdir}
