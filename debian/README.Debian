PostgreSQL for Debian
=====================

PostgreSQL is the successor to Postgres95, which in turn succeeded POSTGRES.
PostgreSQL is a relational database with object-oriented extensions.  It
implements the greater part of SQL-92 and is intended to implement it in full;
in addition it supports its own extended facilities.

Since the on-disk data format of all major PostgreSQL versions (like 7.4,
8.1, etc.) is incompatible to each other, Debian's PostgreSQL packaging
architecture is designed to maintain clusters of different major versions in
parallel.

This postgresql-common package provides the common infrastructure and all
frontend programs that users and administrators use. The version specific
server and client programs are shipped in postgresql-*-<version> packages.

For a detailled description of the architecture, please see

  /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/architecture.html

First steps for the impatient
-----------------------------
Eventually you will not get around reading at least some parts of the manual,
but if you want to get straight into playing SQL, here are the steps to create
a database user and a database for the Unix user 'joe':

1. Install a database server with the major version of your choice,
   preferrably the latest version (e. g. 'postgresql-8.1'). This will
   automatically create a default cluster 'main' with the database
   superuser 'postgres'.

2. Get a shell for the database superuser 'postgres'. If your system has an
   active root user, use su:

   $ su -c "su -s /bin/sh postgres"

   If your system uses sudo to get administrative rights, use sudo instead:

   joe$ sudo -u postgres sh

3. In this postgres shell, create a database user with the same name as your
   Unix login:

   $ createuser -A -D joe

   For details about the options, see createuser(1).

4. Create a database "joework" which is owned by "joe":

   $ createdb -O joe joework

   For details about the options, see createdb(1).

5. Exit the postgres shell.

6. As user joe, you should now be able to connect to your database with

   $ psql joework


Cluster management
------------------
For managing clusters, the following commands are provided (each with its own
manual page):

   pg_createcluster  - Create a new cluster or integrate an existing one into
                       the postgresql-common architecture.
   pg_dropcluster    - Completely remove a cluster.
   pg_ctlcluster     - Control the server process of a cluster (start, stop,
                       restart).
   pg_lsclusters     - Show a list of all existing clusters and their status.
   pg_upgradecluster - Migrate a cluster from one major version to another one.

SSL
---
The PostgreSQL server packages support SSL, which provides encrypted and
authenticated network communication. SSL should be used if you have an
untrusted network between a database server and a client and these exchange
security sensitive data like passwords or confident database contents.

If the openssl package is installed when installing or upgrading
postgresql-common, a self signed certificate (postgresql.crt) and a private key
(postgresql.pem) is created in /etc/postgresql-common. If you have a "real"
certificate with customized information fields and a signature from an official
Certification Authority, you should replace these files with your own
certificate and key.

When a cluster is created with pg_createcluster, SSL support will
automatically be enabled in that cluster, and symlinks "server.key"
and "server.crt" are created in the data directory which point to the
certificate in /etc/postgresql-common; therefore all clusters use the
same certificate by default. Of course you can replace these symlinks
by cluster-specific certificates. 

In addition, if /etc/postgresql-common/root.crt exists, a symbolic
link "root.crt" will be created in the data directory.
/etc/postgresql-common/root.crt is a dummy file by default, so that
client-side authentication is not performed. To enable it, you should
add some root certificates to it. A reasonable choice is to just
symlink the file to /etc/postgresql-common/postgresql.crt; in this
case, client certificates need to be signed by the postgresql server
certificate, which might be desirable in many cases. See

  file:///usr/share/doc/postgresql-doc-8.1/html/ssl-tcp.html

for details (in package postgresql-doc-8.1).

Autovacuum daemon
-----------------

If you install the "postgresql-contrib-<version>" package, a "pg_autovacuum"
daemon will be automatically started for every cluster. You can configure (or
even disable) the autovacuum parameters globally in
/etc/postgresql-common/autovacuum.conf. If you want to configure a cluster
individually, copy this file into /etc/postgresql/<version>/<cluster>.

Please note that the cron job that vacuums databases every 5 hours (see
/etc/cron.d/postgresql-common) does not do anything for clusters with a running
autovacuum daemon.

Further documentation
---------------------
All commands shipped by postgresql-common have detailled manpages. See
postgresql-common(7) for the documentation of the database client program
wrapping, and user_clusters(5) and postgresqlrc(5) for the cluster
configuration.

The documentation of the database server and client functions, SQL commands,
modules, etc.  documented is shipped in the per-version packages
postgresql-doc-<version>.
