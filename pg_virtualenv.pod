=head1 NAME

pg_virtualenv - Create a throw-away PostgreSQL environment for running regression tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_virtualenv> [B<-ash> B<-v> 'I<version ...>'] I<command>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pg_buildext> creates a virtual PostgreSQL server environment, and sets
environment variables such that I<command> can access the PostgreSQL database
server(s). The servers and I<command> are run in an unshared mount and network
namespace; the servers are created on tmpfses, so actions caused by I<command>
in the database do not affect the running system. The servers are destroyed
when I<command> exits.

The environment variables B<PGHOST>, B<PGDATABASE>, B<PGUSER>, and
B<PGPASSWORD> will be set. Per default, a single new cluster is created on port
B<5432>, using the newest PostgreSQL server version installed. When more
clusters are created for other versions, they will use other port numbers. For
ease of access, the clusters are registered in
F</etc/postgresql-common/pg_service.conf>, with the version number as cluster
name. Clusters can be accessed by passing the connection string
"B<service=>I<version>", e.g. B<psql service=9.2>.

B<pg_createcluster> is used to create the database clusters. The clusters are
named I<version>/regress.

B<pg_virtualenv> must be run as root. I<command> can drop privileges as needed,
provided the environment variables are passed.
