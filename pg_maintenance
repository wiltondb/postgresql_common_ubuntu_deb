=head1 NAME

pg_maintenance - perform maintenance tasks on all clusters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_maintenance> [B<-f>|B<--full>] [B<-a>|B<--analyze>] [B<-v>|B<--verbose>]
[B<--force>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script performs maintenance actions on all databases in all clusters. In
particular, this calls B<vacuumdb> on all databases, which frees up unused
space and helps to improve database performance (if B<--analyze> is specified).

This script is intended to be called regularly in a cronjob.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-f>, B<--full>

Perform a "full vacuum", which is more effective but takes more time
and needs to completely lock tables while working on it.

=item B<-a>, B<--analyze>

Perform some statistical analyses on the tables which helps to improve
database performance. This only needs read access to the tables, thus does
not require any locking.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Passed to B<vacuumdb>, which prints lots of information about the vacuuming and
analysis.

=item B<--force>

By default a cluster is not processed if autovacuuming is enabled for it. If
this option is specified, the cluster is processed regardless of the autovacuum
daemon status.
